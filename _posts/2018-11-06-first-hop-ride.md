Yesterday, I rode the newly-constructed Milwaukee Streetcar, known as [The Hop](https://thehopmke.com). Starting at the St. Paul at Plankinton EB station outside of Pritzlaff Lofts at 4:42 PM, I concluded my journey at the Burns Commons station on Ogden and Prospect. Out of curiosity, I timed my ride and compared it to the [printed schedule](https://thehopmke.com/wp-content/themes/streetcar/img/hop-schedule.pdf).
